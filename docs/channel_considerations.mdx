# Channel considerations and specificities

While the life cycle categories (production, distribution, consumer use and disposal) remain the same for all advertising channels, each channel presents specificities that need to be taken into account for accurate emissions modelling.
For instance: static out-of-home billboards do not have content, just the ad, but they will have a disposal component when the vinyl is removed or recycled.

The below sections describe the considerations and specificities taken into account to model different channels.

## Digital out-of-home (DOOH)

### Boundaries of measurement

DOOH screens, like consumer devices, require energy to display an ad. Energy consumption during the use phase is in fact the highest source of emissions.
However, on the contrary to consumer devices, billboards are owned or leased by media owners who therefore have a high level of operational control over the screen attributes that influence embodied and energy related emissions (venue category, manufacturer, model, size, location and positioning, operating hours, brightness settings etc...). For that reason, we are including emissions from screens' energy usage and production to "media distribution".

### Emissions from screens' energy consumption

On the contrary to [consumer device emissions](./consumer_devices.mdx), we have found no credible research paper describing the power draw of large digital billboards. As such, we estimate for individual screens based on a variety of input data sources (listed in order from most accurate to least accurate):

- Electricity metres installed on the screens themselves and monitoring power draw in near real-time.
- Power bills received by media owners on a monthly, quaterly or yearly basis, for a group of or for individual screens.
- Technical specifications from screen manufacturers like Daktronics, Samsung or Panasonic. We have found that these often document maximum power draw (instead of average power draw), which can lead to an over-estimation of energy consumption.
- Extrapolation based on physical dimensions and one of the above data point for similar screens.
- Extrapolation based on physical dimensions with no other data, off the back of data kindly provided to us by early partners.

When no screen attribute or energy data is available to us for a given screen, we estimate the power draw of that screen to be "the 80th percentile" amongst screens that media owner and/or venue category and/or country (based on statistical relevance). This approach aims to incentivize more media owners to share power draw data with us and the larger advertising industry.

### Impression multiplier

One key difference between the digital out-of-home channel and others is its one-to-many nature, meaning that most likely one ad play can be viewed by multiple individuals around the screen.
For this reason, our modelling is done "per play" and translated to "per impression" through the use of a screen specific average impression multiplier provided by partners (media owners and platforms).

When no impression multiplier data is provided to us for a given screen, we once again estimate that value to be "the 80th percentile" amongst screens that media owner and/or venue category and/or country (based on statistical relevance).
