# Creative

## Methodology

The lifecycle of a creative starts with its production. Depending on the channel and format, creative production can be very lightweight (typing a couple of lines of text into a search tool) or have a significant carbon footprint (an on-location shoot with a full crew). Currently, this project does not include modeling creative production, but we are considering this for future development.

The use phase of a creative has three areas of impact:

- The [consumer device](./consumer_devices) uses energy to display the creative
- Energy is used to [transfer](./data_transfer) the creative from a server to the device
- Various [vendors](./ad_tech_model) participate in the delivery and reporting of the creative.

### Consumer Device Emissions

The energy used by the consumer during the display of the creative is determined by multiplying the duration of the creative by the energy use of the consumer device.

For instance, a 30 second video ad played on a television will use 0.73 Wh of energy and an allocation of 0.63 gCO2e from the production of the television (see [consumer device methodology](./consumer_devices) for details on these numbers).

For a banner or native ad that does not have an inherent duration and does not generally use the full screen, we assume a 1 second duration based on the MRC viewability standard.

### Data Transfer Emissions

For video creatives, we use a slightly modified version of the the Carbon Trust "Power Model" to calculate emissions as described in the [data transfer methodology](./data_transfer). This uses the duration, network type, and device type to calculate the marginal impact of the creative on network infrastructure.

For banner and text ads, we use the conventional model based on the payload of a creative (the number of bytes transferred to display the ad). We calculate the energy used per GB from the [data transfer methodology](./data_transfer) based on the network type.

### Vendor Emissions

For each vendor that participates in delivering and tracking the creative, we need to calculate the emissions per creative delivery request. This is part of the [ad tech vendor methodology](./ad_tech_model).

| Payload Size | bytes                       | yes      | Banner only      |
| Duration     | seconds (float)             | yes      | Video only       |
| Impressions  | integer                     | yes      |                  |
| Network Type | fixed, mobile               | yes      |                  |
| Device Type  | mobile, pc, tablet, tv, ooh | yes      |                  |

### Output parameters

| Parameter                 | Values |
| ------------------------- | ------ |
| Device Energy             | kWh    |
| Device Embodied Emissions | gCO2e  |
| Data Transfer Energy      | kWh    |

## Use Case: Banner Ad

| Parameter    | Values | Comments                          |
| ------------ | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| Format       | banner |                                   |
| Payload Size | 24882  | The size of the creative in bytes |
| Impressions  | 831211 |                                   |
| Network Type | mobile |                                   |
| Device Type  | mobile |                                   |

This will output:
| Parameter | Value | Comments |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Device Energy | 0.18 kWh | 1 x 831211 x 0.77 / 3600 / 1000 |
| Device Embodied Emissions | 4322.3 gCO2e | 1 x 831211 x 0.0052|
| Data Transfer Energy | 2.70 kWh | 0.14 kWh/GB x 24882 / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 GB x 831211 |

At 390 g/kWh, this creative execution would generate 5.4 kg of CO2e.

## Use Case: Video ad on CTV

| Parameter    | Value  | Comments |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- |
| Format       | video  |          |
| Duration     | 30     |          |
| Impressions  | 831211 |          |
| Network Type | fixed  |          |
| Device Type  | tv     |          |

This will output:

| Parameter                 | Value          | Comments                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Device Energy             | 605.4 kWh      | 30 x 831211 x 87.4 / 3600 / 1000            |
| Device Embodied Emissions | 523662.9 gCO2e | 30 x 831211 x 0.021                         |
| Data Transfer Energy      | 69.3 kWh       | 10W x 30s x 831211 / 3600 s/h / 1000 Wh/hWh |

At 390 g/kWh, this creative execution would generate 787 kg of CO2e.
